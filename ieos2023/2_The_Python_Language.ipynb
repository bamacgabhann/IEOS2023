    "But that's not where the power of python lies. Rather, the power lies in the numerous packages - over 300,000 on PyPI - which have already been written for python, for everything from the simplest operations all the way to machine learning and AI.\n",

But even most of the Standard Library isn't loaded by default - only the subset referred to as the built-in functions (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). Loading elements requires memory, so to keep memory use low, you only bring in what's needed. So the first part of virtually every python file is doing just that, via import statements.\n",

    "\n",
    "To understand why Python is such a powerful language, you have to understand something of programming languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Classic, old-school languages like FORTRAN - which my mother used in the 1970s - are _compiled_ languages. There's still a lot of these around - FORTRAN is still there, albeit rare, as is PASCAL; C is the basis of much of modern computer architecture, with the C++ and C# variants; there's even new compiled languages, for example Rust, which will probably be my next language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compiled languages take the code you have written and translate it to machine-readable byte code before you can run it. This compilation is heavily dependant on machine architecture and operating system - which is why you have different versions of software for PC, Mac, and Linux. \n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of compiling code is that it's fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantage is that you have to be very specific about everything: for example, if you want a variable, you have to specify what kind of data it will hold, and how much memory it will take up. This means compiled languages are generally not particularly user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a _dynamic_ language - it's not compiled. Instead, when you run a python script, it is passed to the Python Interpreter (which is written and compiled in C), which translates the code and runs it. This intermediate step means you have a lot more latitude. You can assign variables, change their type, change their size - and the interpreter will deal with all the management.\n",
