While that's a strength, it also comes with a problem, that these packages are reliant on volunteers to updates them - and they're not all maintained at the same rate. So, sometimes you'll have a project using Package A for Python 3.10 which relies on Package B; and another project using Package C, which relies on an ealier version of Package A for Python 3.6 and hasn't been updated yet. \n",

Unfortunately, you don't usually know what those will be until you've been using Python for a while, but in order to use Python for a while first you need to have tools for virtual environments and package management. So you need to choose something before you're ready, and of course changing later can be awkward. \n",

Many packages aren't in the conda default channel, but are published to the conda-forge channel repository.
